# React And Express Login System
This is a fullstack app made using React on the frontend and Express on the backend. The app is a simple login system where the user is asked to enter in credentials and if they are correct they are logged in.

## Features
- Basic Authentication 
    - Users can login by providing a username and password

- Appropriate HTTP status code responses

- Backend routing
    - Organised route handling using the express router
    
- Middleware
    - CORS: allows cross-origin requests 
    - Logging: The app utilises Morgan for HTTP request logging

## How To Use
1. First clone the repository using the `git clone` command
2. Navigate into the project directory then into the client directory and then into the login-system directory
3. Make sure you have Node downloaded and run the `npm install` or `npm i` command to install all of the frontend dependencies.
4. After the dependencies have downloaded start the react server by running the command `npm start`
5. Open a new terminal and navigate to the project directory, then navigate to the Login-System directory, and finally to the server directory.
6. Run the `npm install` or `npm i` command to install all of the backend dependencies.
7. After the depenedencies have downloaded, run the following command `node server.js` to start the Express.js server
8. When you started the react server up your browser should have automatically opened at localhost:3000, if it didn't do so now.
9. Enter different usernames and passwords.

## Acceptable Usernames And Passwords
Currently the system only has two eligible users they are:
- Username: zack
- Password: zaack
-------------------------
- Username: jake213
- Password: 123jakle
